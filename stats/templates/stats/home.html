                <h3>Bitcoin in a GenZ</h3>
                <p class="text-justify bg-light text-dark">As a GenZ i think that Bitcoin was one Tops Inventions of the 21 century, because of the freedom that gives people, literally anyone with an internet connection can buy and sell BitCoin. You can also do transactions between two entities without the need of the third-party, because of the bitcoin architecture. Bitcoin lets two persons exchange value, without the confirmation of one bank. This is made by cryptographic functions that confirm if the transaction can be made. Bitcoin also lets two person, exchange bitcoins between two different country, in a few minutes. Not the tradicional away that takes days and high feeds. Another aspect of bitcoin that i like is it's limit supply, for that reason no central government can print money just because they need it, and make the richer and the poor, poorer.<p>
                <p class="text-justify bg-light text-dark">The First i ear about Bitcoin was in 2017, when the value was around 1200$, right before the big spike. I never dream that bitcoin could 50x the value. I remember listening to everybody talk about bitcoin, from the tradicional media to the simple street man. Didn´t bought any, because i was broke, and i know that the small change of the price i would sell it, right away. Volatility is one of my biggest concerns, not just in Bitcoin, in this space. In one day you are up 50% and the next you are down 30%. One thing that i do when i invest in some token, is try to learn the fundamentals, and follow them. Bitcoin for example,  in my view, is good at storing value, is a good asset against the inflation and could became the digital gold. Those are the fundamentals that i follow when investing in Bitcoin. I don't think bitcoin is gonna became a method of payment, because is too slow. Maybe with a second layer. Another aspect of bitcoin that concerns me, is the amount of energy that consumes and where the energy comes from. Indirectly by owing bitcoin i am supporting the heavy use of energy. </p>
